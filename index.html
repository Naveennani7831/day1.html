<h3>About thisApp:<h3>
<p>Why is it called Spotify?
In 2006, in Stockholm, Daniel and Martin created Spotify.

The name condenses the words “Spotlight” and “Identify.” It is not illogical when you consider that Spotify is, first and foremost, a tool for finding songs identified in advance by its users.<br>Spotify is a digital music, podcast, and video service that gives you access to millions of songs and other content from creators all over the world.
